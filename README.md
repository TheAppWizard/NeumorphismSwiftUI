# NeumorphismSwiftUI
This project can be used for implementation of Neumorphism with help of SwiftUI


# About Neumorphism
1. It uses highlights and shadows to define the shapes of objects on the screen.
2. Contrast is generally reduced; full white or black aren’t used, which is what allows the highlights and shadows to stand out.

# Results
The end result is an “extruded plastic” look – a user interface design that certainly looks fresh and interesting without being harsh on your eyes.
